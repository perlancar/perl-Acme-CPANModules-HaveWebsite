NAME
    Acme::CPANModules::GrepVariants - Grep-like CLI utilities available on
    CPAN

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of Acme::CPANModules::GrepVariants
    (from Perl distribution Acme-CPANModules-GrepVariants), released on
    2020-04-16.

DESCRIPTION
    Grep-like CLI utilities available on CPAN.

    Improvements

    Created in 2005 by Andy Lester, ack is the granddaddy of grep-like
    programs that try to improve the experience of using grep to search for
    text in source code. ack skips VCS directories like ".git" or ".svn",
    and understands file types so it doesn't look into giant ".mp4"s and
    other binaries by default. ack has spurred the development of other ack
    improvements (mostly in speed aspect) like The Silver Searcher ("ag") or
    "ripgrep". "git" also now includes a "git-grep" utility. ack has a
    website: <https://beyondgrep.com>. See also <https://betterthanack.com>.

    App::Greple and App::abgrep try to make searching for multiple patterns
    in grep easier. To search for all 'foo' and 'bar' in grep in no
    particular order, you either have to do something like:

     % grep --color=always foo FILES | grep bar

    or:

     % grep -P 'foo.*bar|bar.*foo' FILES

    both of which get unwieldy if the number of patterns get higher. Or you
    can use look-ahead:

     % grep -P '(?=.*foo)(?=.*bar)' FILES

    but this does not capture (thus highlight) the patterns.

    Note that searching for multiple patterns in particular order
    ('foo.*bar'), or searching for aternates from multiple patterns
    ('foo|bar') is no problem in grep.

    greple also has a few other tricks up its sleeve, like configuration
    file to define complex regexes, matching across lines, and Japanese text
    support.

    Instead of specifying a pattern, with App::rpgrep you can specify a
    pattern name in a Regexp::Pattern::* module instead.

    Reimplementations

    grep for PerlPowerTools simply tries to reimplement grep in Perl, as
    part of the project to reimplement many Unix utilities in Perl. It has
    few practical uses.

    Searching Perl source code

    App::pmgrep lets you grep over locally installed Perl modules. It's
    basically a shortcut for something like this:

     % pmlist -Rx | grep PAT
     % grep PAT C<pmlist -Rx>

    App::Grepl uses PPI to let you grep over Perl *documents*; it allows you
    to do things like: search only in Perl code comments or inside string
    literals.

    **Searching other than files: **

FAQ
  What are ways to use this module?
    Aside from reading it, you can install all the listed modules using
    cpanmodules:

        % cpanmodules ls-entries GrepVariants | cpanm -n

    or Acme::CM::Get:

        % perl -MAcme::CM::Get=GrepVariants -E'say $_->{module} for @{ $LIST->{entries} }' | cpanm -n

    This module also helps lcpan produce a more meaningful result for "lcpan
    related-mods" when it comes to finding related modules for the modules
    listed in this Acme::CPANModules module.
